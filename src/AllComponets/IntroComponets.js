                        One of the most commonly used acronyms in the world of education is IT; still very few actually know what this field is all about. In a layman’s word, this is a study which covers the use of computer systems. Perhaps that is why IT has become a synonym of computers for a common man. However, IT has many more things to offer and is not just confined to the boundaries of the computer system and is used to study the use of varied systems, such as telecommunications. According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s dictionary, Information Technology is “the study or use of electronic equipment, especially computers, for storing, accessing, analysing and sending information”. This means that the students choosing this field have to deal with many things like the infrastructure, development, storage, processing, and networking of devices apart from exchanging various forms of electronic data and its security. In fact,security has become a major threat to the future of IT.
